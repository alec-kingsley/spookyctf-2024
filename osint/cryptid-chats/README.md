# cryptid-chats
## Description
> We know the Dr. Tom is currently on the lookout for another cryptid. We think he might have made a mistake and is instead following someone in a costume. We got a tip that Dr. Tom was harassing a famous actor who happened to be in costume for their upcoming movie and was simply visiting a business because they had posted about him recently on their social media. We hacked into Dr. Tom's phone and got a picture from where he started and the path he took. It must've been pretty realistic - do you know what the character is called?

## Solve
After messing with OW_Spot.png, I reconstructed a plaque.

The plaque had "MARTIAN LANDING SITE" at the top right, and the date 1938 in the middle. I searched this date and year, and found the [site](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Martian+Landing+Site+Marker/@40.3127608,-74.6056239,79m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x89c3e17893d0dfdb:0xb53a6cf1c43a62a9!2sMartian+Landing+Site+Marker!8m2!3d40.3127991!4d-74.6055554!16s%2Fg%2F11gzqr4d2g!3m5!1s0x89c3e17893d0dfdb:0xb53a6cf1c43a62a9!8m2!3d40.3127991!4d-74.6055554!16s%2Fg%2F11gzqr4d2g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

I then followed the paths that were described in the texts, and found the Historical Society of West Windsor. I checked out their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/schenckfarmstead/), and saw a [recent post](https://www.instagram.com/schenckfarmstead/p/DBEA1AxK_kg/) about Ethan Hawke. I looked up his upcoming films, and found that he is to be The Grabber in the 2025 film The Black Phone 2.
